# About the OpenAQ Code of Conduct

OpenAQ exists to serve the community of individuals and institutions that are working to advance a clean air future. We value the involvement of everyone in this community and are committed to fostering a friendly and respectful place for learning and sharing knowledge about air quality and contributing to the OpenAQ data platform. All participants in our repositories, communication channels, and events are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

Everyone participating in OpenAQ activities is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by OpenAQ including, but not limited to, online forums, GitHub activities, workshops, and trainings.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report the violation to [info@openaq.org](mailto:info@openaq.org). If the violation occurs during an OpenAQ-hosted event, please contact the host and/or coordinator. All reports will be kept confidential.


# The OpenAQ Code of Conduct

OpenAQ is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. We recognize that some individuals and groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. This discrimination may be due to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, and/or age. OpenAQ does not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason. Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort.

Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. OpenAQ prohibits certain forms of behavior in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  - written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in a specific group listed above
  - sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications
  - publication of private communication without consent
  - commercial solicitation of goods or services (and, on the flip side, denigrating remarks about specific commercial interests)
  - the display of sexual or violent images
  - unwelcome sexual attention
  - non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact
  - incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
  - continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
  - causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation

Behavior not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. As you interact with the OpenAQ community, consider how to enrich the conversation in a respectful way that treats everyone with the utmost respect. 

All OpenAQ interactions must be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs online or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of this Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.
Thank you for helping make OpenAQ a welcoming, friendly community for all.
